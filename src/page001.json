        "content": "A Mexican man who spoke no English went into a department store to buy socks. He found his way to the menswear department where a young lady offered to help him. 'Quiero calcetines,' said the man. 'I don't speak Spanish, but we have some very nice suits over here,' said the salesgirl. 'No, no quiero trajes. Quiero calcetines,' said the man. 'Well, these shirts are on sale this week,' declared the salesgirl. 'No, no quiero camisas. Quiero calcetines,' repeated the man. 'I still don't know what you're trying to say. We have some fine pants on this rack,' offered the salesgirl. 'No, no quiero pantalones. Quiero calcetines,' insisted the man. 'These sweaters are top quality,' the salesgirl probed. 'No, no quiero sueter. Quiero calcetines,' said the man. 'Our undershirts are over here,' fumbled the salesgirl, beginning to lose patience. 'No, no quiero camisetas. Quiero calcetines,' the man repeated. As they passed the underwear counter, the man spotted a display of socks and happily grabbed a pair. Holding them up he proclaimed, 'Eso sí que es!' 'Why didn't you just spell it in the first place?!' yelled the salesgirl.",
