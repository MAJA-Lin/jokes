		- **Judge: How could you kill 24 people? What the hell was wrong with you?**
		- Driver: I was driving at 50mph (80kmh) when I saw two men crossing the road. On the roadside, there was a restaurant with outside seating. I wanted to apply the brakes, but I realized they were not working. So I had to take a decision: Either hit the 2 men or run into the restaurant.
		- Judge: Hit the 2 men of course!
		- Driver: Exactly! After hitting the first man, the other man ran inside the restaurant so l followed him.
