	- ## Content
		- **A man is sitting in a new sports car when a little girl pulls up beside him on her new bicycle she just received for Christmas.**
		- She knocks on his window, which he rolls down to see what she wants.
		- "Wanna race, mister?" she asks, ringing her bell and twirling the elastic streamers on her handlebars.
		- "Sure," the man laughs. The light turns green and he floors the pedal. The car takes off like a shot and he leaves the little girl in the dust.
		- A few seconds later though, he sees something gaining on him in his mirror, fast. He just barely catches a glimpse of the little girl on her bike as she shoots past him. "She must be going 80 miles per hour!" he shouts, and shifts into a higher gear, pushing the car even faster.
		- He quickly blasts past her as if she were standing still. But again, just a few seconds later, she shoots past him, now doing over a hundred miles an hour on her little bike. Going so fast, sparks and smoke are streaming from her training wheels.
		- After another few seconds, he comes to a curve where he sees the little girl crashed in a heap on the side of the road. He pulls over and jumps out to see if she's okay. Miraculously she's survived. So he asks, "Why did you go so fast?"
		- Just as she falls unconscious, the little girl replies, "my streamers got caught on your mirror!"
