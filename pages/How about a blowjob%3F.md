	- ## Content
		- Two married buddies are out drinking one night when one turns to the other and says,
		- "You know, I don't know what else to do. Whenever I go home after we've been out drinking,
		- I turn the headlights off before I get to the driveway.
		- I shut off the engine and coast into the garage.
		- I take my shoes off before I go into the house, I sneak up the stairs, I get undressed in the bathroom.
		- I ease into bed and my wife STILL wakes up and yells at me for staying out so late!"
		- His buddy looks at him and says,
		- "Well, you are obviously taking the wrong approach.
		- I screech into the driveway, slam the door, storm up the steps,
		- throw my shoes into the closet, jump into bed, rub my hands on my wife's ass and say, 'How about a blowjob?'
		- .....And she always sounds asleep."
