		- A man had a 25" long penis and it created difficulties in his life as it was not easy to move around with it and women were afraid of him too. He also had a very high pitched voice.
		- He went to see a doctor. "What can I do about my enormous penis?" he asked in a high pitched voice.
		- The doctor examined him carefully. "Your penis is so large that you can't get any blood to your vocal chords. But we can do a penis transplant, to give you a normal sized penis, and that will fix your voice."
		- The man thought about it. "Okay," he said in his high pitched voice.
		- He woke up after the operation and he felt great. His new penis was a normal size. He could walk, he could run, and best of all, his voice was completely normal!
		- But after a few weeks he realized having a 25-inch penis was pretty cool. Finally he went back to the doctor. "I've thought about it and I would like to undo the operation."
		- "That's impossible," the doctor said in a high pitched voice.
