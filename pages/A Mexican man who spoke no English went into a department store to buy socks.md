		- "No, no quiero trajes. Quiero calcetines," said the man.
		- "Well, these shirts are on sale this week," declared the salesgirl.
		- "No, no quiero camisas. Quiero calcetines," repeated the man.
		- "I still don't know what you're trying to say. We have some fine pants on this rack," offered the salesgirl.
		- "No, no quiero pantalones. Quiero calcetines," insisted the man.
		- "These sweaters are top quality," the salesgirl probed.
		- "No, no quiero sueter. Quiero calcetines," said the man.
		- "Our undershirts are over here," fumbled the salesgirl, beginning to lose patience.
