	- ## Content
		- A Mexican man who spoke no English went into a department store to buy socks.
		- He found his way to the menswear department where a young lady offered to help him.
		- "Quiero calcetines," said the man.
		- "I don't speak Spanish, but we have some very nice suits over here," said the salesgirl.
		- "No, no quiero trajes. Quiero calcetines," said the man.
		- "Well, these shirts are on sale this week," declared the salesgirl.
		- "No, no quiero camisas. Quiero calcetines," repeated the man.
		- "I still don't know what you're trying to say. We have some fine pants on this rack," offered the salesgirl.
		- "No, no quiero pantalones. Quiero calcetines," insisted the man.
		- "These sweaters are top quality," the salesgirl probed.
		- "No, no quiero sueter. Quiero calcetines," said the man.
		- "Our undershirts are over here," fumbled the salesgirl, beginning to lose patience.
		- "No, no quiero camisetas. Quiero calcetines," the man repeated.
		- As they passed the underwear counter, the man spotted a display of socks and happily grabbed a pair.
		- Holding them up he proclaimed, **"Eso sí que es!"**
		- "Why didn't you just spell it in the first place?!" yelled the salesgirl.
