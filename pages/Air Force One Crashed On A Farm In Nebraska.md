	- ## Content
		- Air Force One crashed on a farm in Nebraska.
		- Panic stricken, the local sheriff mobilized and descended on the farm in force. When they got there, the disaster was clear. The aircraft was totally destroyed with only a burned hull left smoldering in a tree line that bordered a farm.
		- The sheriff and his men entered the smoking mess but did not find the remains of anyone, including the President. They spotted a lone farmer ploughing a field not too far away as if nothing at all happened. They hurried over to the man's tractor.
		- "Hank," the sheriff yelled, panting and out of breath. "Did you see this terrible accident happen?"
		- "Yup. Sure did," the farmer said, cutting off his motor.
		- "Do you realize that is the airplane of the President of the United States?"
		- "Yup."
		- "Were there any survivors?"
		- "Nope. They're all kilt straight out. I done buried them all myself. Took me most of the morning."
		- "Oh my god. President Trump is dead?"
		- "Well," the farmer grumbled, restarting his tractor. "He kept a-saying he wasn't... but you know what a liar he is!"
