	- ## Content
		- Jack, a handsome man, walked into a sports bar around 9:58pm
		- He sat down next to this blonde at the bar and stared up at the TV as the 10:00 news came on. The news crew was covering a story of a man on a ledge of a large building preparing to jump.
		- The blonde looked at Jack and said, "Do you think he'll jump?"
		- Jack says, "You know what, I bet he will."
		- The blonde replied, "Well, I bet he won't."
		- Jack placed $50 on the bar and said, "You're on!"
		- Just as the blonde placed her money on the bar, the guy did a swan dive off the building, falling to his death. The blonde was very upset and handed her $50 to Jack, saying, "Fair's fair... Here's your money."
		- Jack replied, "I can't take your money, I saw this earlier on the 5 o'clock news and knew he would jump."
		- The blonde replied, "I did too, but didn't think he'd do it again."
		- Jack took the money.
