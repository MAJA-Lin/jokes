		- A local business was looking for office help.
		- They put a sign in the window saying:
		- "HELP WANTED. Must be able to type, must be good with a computer and must be bilingual. We are an Equal Opportunity Employer."
		- A short time afterwards, a dog trotted up to the window, saw the sign and went inside.
		- He looked at the receptionist and wagged his tail, then walked over to the sign, looked at it and whined.
		- Getting the idea, the receptionist got the office manager.
		- The office manager looked at the dog and was surprised, to say the least.
		- However, the dog looked determined, so he led him into the office.
		- Inside, the dog jumped up on the chair and stared at the manager.
		- The manager said, "I can't hire you. The sign says you have to be able to type."
		- The dog jumped down, went to the typewriter and proceeded to type out a perfect letter.
		- He took out the page and trotted over to the manager and gave it to him, then jumped back on the chair.
		- The manager was stunned, but then told the dog, "The sign says you have to be good with a computer."
		- The dog jumped down again and went to the computer. The dog proceeded to demonstrate his expertise with various programs and produced a sample spreadsheet and database and presented them to the manager.
		- By this time the manager was totally dumbfounded! He looked at the dog and said, "I realize that you are a very intelligent dog and have some interesting abilities. However, I still can't give you the job."
		- The dog jumped down and went to a copy of the sign and put his paw on the part about being an Equal Opportunity Employer.
		- The manager said, "Yes, but the sign also says that you have to be bilingual."
		- The dog looked at him straight in the face and said, "Meow."
