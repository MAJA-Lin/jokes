		- After a terrible car crash a man wakes up in a hospital with a doctor standing over him.
		- “Good news and bad news, sir. You’re completely fine except you've lost your penis in the car crash.”
		- The man pulls back the bedsheets and the doctor is right, absolutely nothing down there.
		- The doctor tells the man he has more good news and bad news.
		- “You’re in the only hospital in the world that can do penis transplants and we have three in the fridge waiting for you now. The bad news is these are very expensive and have to be paid for privately."
		- "There’s an English penis that costs $15,000."
		- "There’s a Scottish penis that costs $20,000."
		- "Finally, there’s a West Indian penis that costs $30,000.”
		- The man says “Wow, what a relief, that is great news! I'm going to have to run this by my wife first."
		- The doctor steps out to the hallway to send the wife in and says he'll be back in 10 minutes.
		- After 10 minutes pass the doctor returns and asks the man, “Have you decided what you’re going for?”
		- The man replies, “Yes, we've decided to go with a new kitchen.”
